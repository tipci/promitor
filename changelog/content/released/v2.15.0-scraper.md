- {{% tag fixed %}} Azure Monitor Scraper: Fixed a breaking issue where duplicate metric namespaces returned by the Azure API would cause Promitor to fail in some regions (notably Germany West Central). The scraper now deduplicates namespaces and logs a warning if multiple are found, using the first available namespace. This makes Promitor resilient to recent Azure API changes.

Full release notes can be found [here](https://github.com/tomkerkhove/promitor/releases/tag/Scraper-v2.15.0).
